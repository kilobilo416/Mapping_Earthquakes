## Overview of Project ![dark](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105321686/199594831-de493409-ab97-4e20-99b5-083e524850ce.png)

### Purpose 
To Execute using Json files with Leaflet. Generate a script that will output colored circles, notations, and diagrams of tectonic locations along with the magnitude location and amount of the earthquake. The script must have the ability to show the map in different modes including street view, satellite view, and dark view. The map will also provide colored drop-down ranges to help visually see and filter where the size of the earthquakes fall on the map.

## Analysis and Challenges 

### Outcome of Analysis 

After identifying the major fault lines the map now helps visually see where the larger earthquakes occur. It also provides us with the number of earthquakes outside our fault lines that are within a smaller range of magnitude. The data helps us visualize how much activity is outside the fault lines. The data also helps us see how much activity is within the ocean and to what extent of magnitude. Below we can see non-major earthquakes, compared to large earthquakes above.

### Challenges 
Some of the issues i ran into was properly executing my branching in my repository with so many brnahces its easy to loose track. Along with double checking spelling and issues within html and solving this issue with the inspection tool. 


## Summary 
HTML provides a great platform that provides a great visualization of what's happening and also provides good interaction with user once made.
